        <p>I was a simple Hobbit. Just having my breakfats, second breakfast, elevenses, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper.
             <br    />Of course, enjoying the use of my pipe throughout the day as well. Imerely lived my quiet, humble life until...
             <br    />An adventurous wizard requested my help. Thus, bringing me to my true beginning of my life.
            <br     />I may not be considered as a normal, respectable hobbit, due to my leaving the Shire to fill my memories with fun and adventure,
            <br     /> but I do not regret any of the choices.
